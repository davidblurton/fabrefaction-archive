		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sasha,

Sorry I&#039;ve been AWOL for a little while and just spotted this. The cake would feed at least 20 I would say. I haven&#039;t done heaps of chocolate work either, but I would say for anyone wanting to do something like this for an occasion it&#039;s worth having a go at tempering with a small batch of chocolate. The main thing is to open the windows - it&#039;s so much easier in a cold environment.

Hope your cousin liked her cake!

Yes I see no reason this wouldn&#039;t work with transparent cases. The ones I used were different types of plastic and they both worked really well.

Happy crafting!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kay,

Sorry just spotted this! The ones I bought were in multipacks of 3, but that&#039;s the beauty of this recipe - if you have a little too much you can add more rice krispies and vice versa!

Hope you enjoyed them!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi this cake looks fabulous I&#039;m thinking if making this for my cousins 40th birthday party, how many people did it feed?

I might do a black forest version though as it&#039;s her favourite. 

Is it worth practising the chocolate work first as don&#039;t want to mess it up. I do bake quite often but nothing with chocolate work.
Thanks Sasha]]></description>
