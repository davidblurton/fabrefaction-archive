						<p>Hello dear ones, near ones and far away ones.</p>
<p>I’m so sorry for going MIA recently. As I’m sure you can imagine, making all those <a href="/2015/12/18/gingerbread-town-village-house-recipe-template/">gingerbread houses</a> took it out of me a little.</p>
<p>The original plan was to spend my Christmas break stacking up posts for this blog-a-log, as it’s been a bit tricky keeping up with a full time job with no reserve stash of posts to fall back on. In reality all I was capable of at Christmas was eating lots and sleeping more.</p>
<p>So, friends, I’ve made a decision. I need a little break, a hiatus, a small pause.</p>
<p>I’m DEFINITELY coming back. I love this blog, and it’s so much part of my life that I can’t really imagine not doing it.</p>

						<p>So this is later than the usual Monday night. But I hope you’ll forgive me when you see the contents, and when you remember it’s December and that I now have a full-time job.</p>
<p>SPEAKING OF WHICH, I have been fortunate enough to join a team full of kind and kooky misfits, who have made the last three months super fun.</p>
<p>This year, when considering my yearly gingerbread offering I deliberated over how I might transport one into work to share the joy. But when you make gingerbread houses like <a href="/2013/12/19/how-to-make-gingerbread-house/">this</a> and <a href="/2014/12/24/gingerbread-house-2014-recipe/">this</a> and get the central line tube to work, even the thought of attempting that makes you sweat.</p>
<p>The obvious answer? Make little ones for everyone. Sure. That’s not mental at all.</p>

						<p>Afternoon folks! Making the most of my lunch break to post this week because we are officially in Christmas party season. You know what else we&#8217;re in? CHRISTMAS TREE SEASON.</p>
<p>Yes. That&#8217;s right, get yours out of the attic or head down to your local festive pop up, it&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lovely nostalgia people have with their generations old decorations; almost everyone I&#8217;ve talked to about their tree has some kind of heirloom ornament that takes centre stage each year.</p>
<p>I still think it&#8217;s nice to freshen it up from time to time though, and with December costing a fortune, here are some quick and easy christmas tree decorations you can make with things lying around the house/garden.</p>

						<p>Hi all, massive sorrys this week as I’m afraid I went away for the weekend. Working full time again and running out of my little stash of ready posts has meant that I’m empty handed so far as new ideas go this week.</p>
<p>BUT, fear not, for I have now been blogging for two whooooole years. I also quite like Christmas. Here are a few ideas from the last couple of years to keep you ticking over until next week.</p>

						<p>Two years of  friends. Yup. THAT HAPPENED. Thank you for the support and the loving, please keep sharing, commenting and messaging me; I love hearing from you and seeing what you’ve made.</p>
<p>In keeping with my first post ever, and the one year anniversary post of this little blog, here’s another lovely advent calendar for you to make.</p>
<p>“Oh but advent starts next week, I don’t have time!” Yes, yes you do. I made this in a day. Less than really when you consider I went out for breakfast and dinner. You could even take the easy way out and glue instead of sew.</p>
<p>This particularly calendar is a labour of love for my very hardworking and wonderful sister. Poor duck got jealous of mine one year so I got her her own one. I thought it was about time she had something a little more permanent so she never forgets again. Thanks for your love and support sib.</p>

						Stick it, hang it, tag it					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>A classic case of things not turning out quite how they were meant to this week. I’m not sure exactly what I was expecting, but my housemates managed to cajole me into embracing the rustic charm of these makes nonetheless. By the end I managed to accept them as ‘not too bad after all’ and the lack of precision means that they would be a great little craft for kiddies as the winter creeps in.</p>
<p>With Christmas decorating just around the corner these guys are a great finishing touch as tree decorations, tags on presents and for card making. They are cheap to make and are cute little token gifts for the people you love, or at least those you like enough to want to give them something, but not enough to actually apply yourself to Christmas shopping.</p>

						Food innovation at its finest					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>Apologies for the day late post friends. I had a miniature pie melt down at the weekend (#myblogginglife) and as a result didn’t fancy posting yesterday. Instead I took an evening of sitting on the kitchen counters with the housemates eating pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>Speaking of the housemates. A while ago one of mine professed herself to be a food innovator. Bold claim? Yes. I thought so. When I asked for proof of this theory, she was ready with it. “Well,” she said calmly, and with an air of smugness, “I’ve had an excellent idea for mince pie truffles”. Lover of mince pies I am. Did I think this idea was a good one, worthy of the self proclaimed food innovator title? No, reader, I did not.</p>
<p>About a week of scorning later (I cannot put words together to explain how disgusting I thought the idea was and how aggressively I communicated that to her) she returned home with a box of mince pies to prove her idea, totally unfazed, a quality all struggling food innovators must no doubt possess. I’m sure Heston could empathise.</p>
<p>Anyway. Turns out, I like mince pie truffles. You’ll have to trust me on this one. Best eaten from the fridge, sound and look entirely unappetising, ladies and gentlemen, I bring you the recipe for the humble (but great) mince pie truffle.</p>
<p>This post is dedicated to one Ms Afua Addai-Diawuo, food innovator.</p>

						<p>October 31st. 19C in London, beautiful sunshine.</p>
<p>November 1st. Fog, cold, winter has arrived.</p>
<p>Don’t you just love the British weather?! Its unpredictability is a constant irritation to me but I do adore the seasons. I’m very glad I don’t live somewhere that’s variations on one temperature all year round.</p>
<p>It’s starting to feel a little festive this week at Fabrefaction HQ. It’s bonfire night on Thursday, and we are having a housewarming party this weekend to welcome the new housies. It would be rude not to provide our guests with some treats, and even ruder not to acknowledge the approach of Mr Frost.</p>
<p>So here we are, the perfect recipe to bridge autumn and winter, mini gingerbread and honey cupcakes. If you don’t fancy the hassle you could always make this as a traybake, perhaps doubling the recipe (I halved it).</p>

						<p>Guten Tag friends! This week’s blog post is inspired by a lovely German tradition that warmed my little heart when I was told about it.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was sent these photos of a very beloved little boy; you might remember way back when we helped him make <a href="/2014/05/19/kids-birthday-party-hat-invitations/">birthday party invites</a>? Well, about 18 months later and it was the first day of school for our young sir.</p>

						The humble crumble					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>When it comes to autumn blogging, I just can’t get away from apple related ideas. It’s a well known fact that toffee flavours go well with apple so I thought I might wheel out the salted caramel recipe for this week’s post.</p>
<p>We had this after a large roast on Sunday and it was the perfect pud for a cosy autumn afternoon. One of my housemates (self proclaimed crumble connoisseur) called it “the zenith of desserts”, just saying, perhaps this crumble is not so humble after all.</p>

						If you go down to the woods today&#8230;					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>This weekend saw the baby shower of a rather lovely lady by the name of Anna. You may (but probably won’t) remember us celebrating <a href="/2014/06/15/raspberry-meringue-kisses-recipe/">Anna’s hen party</a> a while back, well now she’s about to pop a sprog would you believe?</p>
<p>Anna is a rather large fan of gnomes. Yeah, that was my reaction too, but you learn to embrace it after a while…she’s very endearing that way. Well, our friend Taylor (party planner extraordinaire and all round kindred spirit when it comes to carrying things out to obsessive levels of detail) decided to throw Anna a woodland themed shower. I know right? Cute. I totally took my camera and promptly forgot to take photos of all the lovely things; gingerbread fawns, woodland creature bunting, sausage roll snails and toadstool cupcakes to name just a few.</p>
<p>Anyway, other than baking some little flowerpot grassy gnome type cupcakes, I decided my contribution would be to carry the theme into my present and make a small selection of woodland characters to entertain baby upon her arrival into the world.</p>
<p>So here’s how to make your very own arsenal of woodland animal finger puppets, with a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/284633376/Woodland-Animals-Finger-Puppet-Template">downloadable template</a> of course.</p>

						Save it for a drizzly day					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>This is a recipe for a cake you might have spotted in my <a href="/2015/08/17/hen-party-bridal-shower-homemade-favours/">wrap up post for Vicky’s hen party</a>. I made some vague comment about getting round to it at some point. So here it is.</p>
<p>Lemon drizzle is one of my go-to bakes when I’m in a rush or don’t have the energy to figure out something new. It’s super handy because often you will have the ingredients and just need to grab a lemon. It’s always a crowd pleaser and really quick and easy to make and transport. I prefer to make it in a brownie tin as a tray bake, I’m of the opinion that it bakes quicker and serves more people this way. Plus I often find loaf cakes get a bit of a dry crust while you’re waiting for the inside to cook. No such problem here.</p>
<p>I present to you the lemon drizzle tray bake.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I usually use ounces to weigh this one out because I was brought up on ounces and gas marks (thanks mum), I’m still getting my head round grams and celsius since flying the nest. The UK will forever be trapped between the imperial and metric systems…</p>

<p>With the return of my favourite season (I’m really fair-skinned, so shoot me if I don’t adore summer like the rest of you) and a little dinner party this weekend, I figured the only way to round off my housemate’s uh-mazing main course was with a little homage to the apple.</p>

						Carved from stone					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>Now then, let me tell you about an ongoing battle between two of my favourite people. Beth is a responsible and considered little person who takes a great deal of care over her things. As a result, everything she owns looks brand new and nothing ever gets broken. Amy, whilst she’s not exactly going round throwing her stuff at walls, is the type to put her fingers on your computer screen and is totally incapable of keeping a case on her iPhone. It won’t surprise you to learn this drives Beth to distraction.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Amy, to our disbelief, actually bought a case for her phone. However, when it came to unpacking it unfortunately found she found it didn’t fit. Unsurprisingly, it has not been replaced, but I felt quite sorry for her; she’d finally done what she was told and was not rewarded for her efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I was being berated by another friend (<a href="/2014/06/09/focaccia-recipe/">David</a>) for choosing a practical, but admittedly rather ugly case for my own phone. I had also been admiring the various uses of the nail varnish marbling effect on Pinterest. All this to tell you that today I made myself and Amy phone cases.</p>

<p>So back to business as usual on fabrefaction this week, no more cupcakes for a while, and as far as I know, no more hen parties. I’m sure I will find something else to do a little series on soon though.</p>
<p>I actually did make this rose and vanilla sugar scrub from the left over flowers from Vicky’s hen party, so it’s not entirely true that we are leaving it behind. My advice is not to make this too far in advance if you’re gifting it as the petals did discolour a little.</p>

						<p>Hi there. First off, apologies are in order. I missed my Monday night slot this week. I am deeply entrenched in finishing my portfolio and got really, really, involved in designing a book cover, more on that another time.</p>
<p>ANYWAY. My lovely housemate <a href="/2015/01/19/homemade-party-banner-diy/">Vicky</a> had her Hen Party a few weekends ago. Sadly I had something I had booked up a year in advance to go to so I couldn’t make it. Sad face. Instead I thought I would leave Vicky a little surprise on the dining table so she’d know I was thinking of her while she partied on down with her hens.</p>
<p>This is a little four part series, showing you how to make three different little hen/bachelorette party favours at home; the final post will detail all the finishing touches. You might prefer to use them as wedding favours or for childrens’ parties instead.</p>
<p>Heads up: I made 30 of each recipe, so if you’re looking to make a sweet treat for an evening in, divide, divide, divide the quantities of the recipe, don’t send me the bill for your fillings.</p>
<p>We’re kicking off this week with a recipe for orange sherbet. I just need to clarify for the sake of my US (and possibly Canadian?) readership, we mean something different when we say sherbet. You mean sorbet. We mean sherbet.</p>

						<p>Fanfare please! We have reached the final post of the British favourites series.

Safe to say my family and friends have enjoyed themselves the past few weeks. I should probably do a detox series next.</p>
<p>What better way to top this all off than with the Tunnock&#8217;s tea cake? The Tunnock&#8217;s bakery was founded in 1890, I&#8217;m not sure when the idea of the teacake popped into Mr Tunnock&#8217;s head but I&#8217;m  sure glad it did.</p>

						<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you might remember my dear mother’s ventures into gardening. Last year I made a <a href="/2014/06/23/rhubarb-and-honey-cake-recipe/">rhubarb and honey cake</a> from one of her crops, and this year’s slotted in nicely into this cupcake series. For where would the British public be without rhubarb and custard?</p>
<p>Ok, let’s be honest. We’d probably be fine without rhubarb and custard. I’m not even sure people eat it that much nowadays. But it is pretty nice baked into a cupcake, they really are a great pair. Maybe we ought to resurrect it. Starting now.</p>
<p>Go forth and bake people of Britain (and the rest of the world too if you’re reading this).</p>

						<p>GUYS. I GOT A BLOWTORCH.</p>
<p>I won’t regale you with the tale of trying to fuel said blowtorch because it’s an epic tragedy to rival those of the Greeks. However, at LAST the correct butane was obtained and I held FIRE in my hands. It’s dangerous really. I’m incredibly clumsy. But hey, I’ve wanted one for years, and I was not disappointed.</p>
<p>You don’t actually need a blowtorch for this recipe, but I think everyone should have one so we can compare notes.</p>
<p>So moving on from my pyromaniac tendencies…my mum’s lemon meringue pie takes some beating. And by that, I mean, nobody has beaten it. Ever. I have a separate stomach that’s just for lemon meringue pie.</p>
<p>There would be no completing this British favourites series (not that we’re completing it today, buckle up friend) without lemon meringue pie. I’m actually a bit torn, because how can you convert something as delicious as lemon meringue into a cupcake recipe? Well. I tried it. They’re pretty yummy.</p>

						Minty fresh					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>Welcome back friend.</p>
<p>Week five of the British favourites cupcakes, and before we begin, I have a minor claim to fame on this one. My grandad used to engrave the embossing plates for the clock that characterises this evening treat. You know the old one with all the swirls n’ stuff.</p>
<p>Any guesses? The After Eight dinner mint you say? Dang straight.</p>
<p>Now, I know mint as a flavour polarises people, but I’m generally a fan. I can do away with a whole box of these if I’m in the right mood.</p>
<p>As far as the cake version goes, you don’t have to go too crazy, a little hint of mint really sets off the dark chocolate in this recipe nicely. The cake is made without eggs and butter so it’s light and fluffy allowing for a nice rich ganache icing. This is probably one of the easiest recipes in this little series, so if baking makes you nervous, start here.</p>
<p>As I’ve started sounding like the baking equivalent of a used car salesman we better make a start.</p>

						<p>Burning the midnight oil to bring you this week’s British favourite. The reason being is that my rather lovely friend took me along to a screen printing workshop for a little birthday treat tonight. If you want to have a cheeky stalk there’s a *few* pictures on <a href="https://instagram.com/katiemclurg/">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Back to this week though, and the question of a another cupcake and a few bananas. Of course, it’s about time the classic banoffee pie made an appearance in this little series. There’re few things that pair better than banana and caramel in my opinion, so it took quite a lot of focus not to just make the toffee filling and skip off to the garden with a bowl of banana to suffocate in sauce. I mean, if you’re going to eat fruit, do it right.</p>

						The only good thing to come from Eton*					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>Eton Mess. One of the best summer puds going. You might disagree with me, but you would be wrong. There’s nothing quite like strawberries and meringue where this person is concerned. I’ll even put down my chocolate for it. Though, most likely, if I’m at a barbecue, I’m just skipping the savoury to make way for the chocolate option <em>and</em> the Eton Mess.</p>
<p>Enough of my complete incapacity to avoid sweet things. Onto this week’s British favourites cupcake instead. Probably unsurprisingly given my rambling introduction it’s the recipe for Eton Mess cupcakes.</p>
<p>This recipe uses seven minute swiss meringue frosting. It’s the first time I’ve made it and it was pretty darn easy, so definitely give it a bash. I did notice that over a couple of days it hardens and basically becomes a meringue, and mine was a touch gritty. I think the best thing to do is make them and allow to sit out for a couple of hours so the outside hardens a little but the inside is still fluffy and smooth. A make on the day jobby if you can I reckon.</p>

						<p>Week two of the British favourites series. One of the most heavily contested treats in GB, it had to go to court in 1991 to establish once and for all if it were a cake or a biscuit to make sure McVitie’s (its creators) were in the right tax category.</p>
<p>This version is 100% a cake and I dare say my favourite of this series, though there are a few still to be baked, so we’ll see.</p>

<p>The other day I was handed a Bakewell tart on the street (by a man in a co-op uniform, don’t worry, I’m not taking sweets from strangers). It’s been a while since I had a Bakewell tart, and you know what? I actually quite enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Then the thought struck me…a series of British sweets/puds baked into cupcakes is just what this blog needs.</p>
<p>For anyone who doesn’t know, a Bakewell tart has a pastry case, full of frangipane (almond), cherry jam and is topped with a thick layer of icing and half a glacé cherry.</p>
<p>So without further ado let’s kick off with an easy peasy Bakewell tart cupcake, which are also handily dairy free for our lactose intolerant friends.</p>

						Crabbie birthday to you					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>Another week another birthday. This time round it’s my lovely housemate who is bravely entering her mid-twenties; just another excuse for me to get in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week Vicky (the birthday girl in question), Matt (<a title="Banner-tastic" href="/2015/01/19/homemade-party-banner-diy/">the fiance</a>) and I, had sat down to watch The Princess Bride (a hilarious farce of a film), and we cracked open some Crabbie’s. It was such a lovely little evening, and I thought I would bake the experience into a cake to commemorate the little one’s birth.</p>
<p>Crabbie’s, for anyone who doesn’t know (more fool you), is alcoholic ginger beer. This particular batch was raspberry flavoured, and  nobody was more surprised than me to discover how nicely ginger and raspberry complement each other. Add to that a honey and vanilla icing and you’ve got a birthday cake fit for any 24 year old.</p>

						Oh Iceland					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>Hi there, thanks for swinging by.</p>
<p>This week I went on my merry travels to visit some rather beloved friends. They’ve taken themselves off to Iceland to live for a while. Though I miss them a fair bit, it’s not such a terrible holiday destination for a person who loves photography, walking and general landscape (that’s me by the way).</p>
<p>We had ourselves a little road trip while I was there, naturally my stomach is my priority in all circumstances so we stocked up nicely in the snacks department. Having the luxury of doing none of the driving (Iceland is kinda wild, and my driving leaves a little to be desired), meant that I plenty of time to consume, and became totally addicted to Hraun. Pronounced something along the lines of hhhhruin, these little guys are something I might have passed by if shopping alone, but are pretty darn yummy. I also saw a box at the airport called ‘Icelandic Mountain Bars’, which is significantly easier to say.</p>
<p>So to give you (me) a break from all that <a title="Chocstravagant!" href="/2015/04/06/two-tier-chocolate-salted-caramel-fudge-cake-recipe/">two tiered chocolate cake</a> making you’ve (I’ve) been doing, here’s my recreation of my new favourite treat.</p>

						<p>A couple of weeks ago one of my favourite colleagues had a special birthday, so for a special birthday we needed a special cake.</p>
<p>I had only attempted one two tier cake before and had never made the chocolate collar you’ll see below. Sure this cake was a bit more effort than your average victoria sponge, but if you’ve got a few hours and a bit of patience and determination this is very much possible.</p>
<p>I present to you a full step-by-step recipe for a two tiered chocolate fudge cake with salted caramel buttercream, decorated with a dark chocolate collar and chocolate dipped berries. I just wanted to say that out loud. Look away if you don’t like chocolate. This won’t please you.</p>

						<p>Hullo again, with Easter well and truly around the corner, here’s another cute bunny-themed bake for you.</p>
<p>I found an adorable mould for tiny carrots online when browsing for chocolate moulds, as you do on payday…right? I couldn’t resist pairing them with the gorgeous little flowerpot shaped cupcake cases my lovely pal Taylor bought me for my birthday a couple of years back.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, there was an obvious flavour choice for these and I pried myself away from my usual chocolate bakes to bring you carrot muffins/cupcakes with cream cheese frosting.</p>
<p>This makes 6 cupcakes, so you will want to double it for more or for a single cake.</p>

What’s that? You didn’t realise Mother’s day was so soon? I know, right? Me neither. It’s this Sunday for those of you in GB, the rest of you should check your calendars, this is the sneakiest holiday of the year.</p>
<p>This is a super super easy way to make a treat for your Ma.

<p>This time round however, Spring came early to a very special household. My wonderful friends Hannah and David had a BEAUTIFUL baby boy earlier this month, shaking off the winter blues. I’m head over heels for the little bundle already and can’t wait to see him grow.</p>

						<p>I’m going to call it before you do. I am a tiny bit cheating in this post. Back in November my housemate Vicky and I made <a title="Dough-nutty" href="/2014/11/03/toffee-apple-cinder-toffee-doughnut-recipe/">Bonfire Night doughnuts</a>. It was an epic feat of baking, one I vowed not to repeat for a very long time. That is, until my teacher at college had a birthday last week and I took to the kitchen again to make a maple themed bun in honour of his Canadian homeland.</p>
<p>So I confess. Given that doughnuts are a touch on the complex side, I’ve repeated many of the photos from November. It’s a lot easier to get snap happy when there’s a spare set of eyes to watch the pan of hot oil, so don’t judge me too harshly friends.</p>

<p>My fellow Europeans will have to excuse me for edging towards the North American style of pancake (you can add more flavours this way, but I assure you I’m still a die hard fan of our traditional flat friends). Those of you across the pond will also have to excuse me for not adding sugar and melted butter and all that nonsense to the mix.</p>

						Santa&#8217;s print shop					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>On the first day of December it feels a little rude to not present you with a Christmas post. I’m a huge fan of the festive season, so you’re lucky I held back as long as I did.</p>
<p>Last year I was meandering around a craft fair and spotted a lino print stall. Now I tried lino printing at secondary school, and it made me a bit cross. I am a big fan of precision and this craft definitely comes with a dollop of ‘rustic handmade’.</p>
<p>This was my first bash at lino cutting and printing since the age of 14 I figure the extra years of ‘get over yourself’ and the added dexterity contributed significantly to making this a very satisfying little project.</p>
<p>You do need a little more ‘specialist’ equipment this time than usual, but you can set yourself up relatively cheaply with the kit. I used a combo of Amazon and <a href="http://www.handprinted.net/">Handprinted</a>.</p>

						<p>There’s lots of things happening right now. The first one to mention is that fabrefaction TURNS 1 TODAY! I know, crazy right? I will leave any sentimental ramblings to my new year post, but it seems mad to me that my first little blog about an <a title="Homemade advent calendar" href="/2013/11/24/how-to-make-advent-calendar/">advent calendar made from egg boxes </a>was only a year ago.</p>
<p>The other major thing that’s happening is that <a title="A hearty task" href="/2014/10/13/hanging-heart-garland-wedding-decoration/">MEGAN IS GETTING MARRIED</a>. In 12 days no less. Gawsh.</p>
<p>In honour of this we had a hen party last weekend in beautiful Bath. For part of the afternoon we had time to kill and every activity we looked up was crazy expensive or not available etc etc. After some deliberation it was suggested that I conjure up something to do.</p>
<p>So in honour of Meg’s wedding, fabrefaction’s birthday, and being as close as we are to December, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to use our make shift craft workshop to make an heirloom for Meg and Olly to obligingly hang at Christmas…at least as long as we’re friends…which will be forever, so…</p>

						<p>A couple of months ago my lovely housemate got engaged. A couple of weeks ago we celebrated that fact.</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to make some party food. Given that we’re fast approaching Christmas (I mean, it’s the 17th November already, what?) this little series of posts should furnish your party season with delightful nibbles and may double as last minute Christmas present/hostess gifts.</p>
<p>This one falls into the second category, so get online and buy yourself some cellophane bags and a roll of ribbon, your colleagues and your milk man will never have been happier. Well, I hope their lives are better than that, but either way, there won’t be any disappointment, and that’s all anyone’s looking for at Christmas.</p>

						<p>Another little post about our half term day of fun. I hope you will forgive the lack of photos given I was supervising two little humans at the time.</p>
<p>I had promised my little friends that we would take a trip to the cinema during our visit, but it turned out there was nothing worth going to the cinema for.</p>
<p>Ever the crafter I decided we would recreate our own home cinema experience. I conjured up a recipe for toffee popcorn and made some popcorn boxes and tickets.</p>

						Half term hair bands					</h4>
															<div class="builder-gallery-description">
						<p>This half term holiday I had promised two little friends of mine a day in my London pad. They were very excited and had all kinds of crafty plans and ideas to keep us busy.</p>
<p>When thinking about what we could do on a budget, I remembered learning how to sew when not much older than them.</p>
<p>I was pretty impressed with these two; by the end they were using the sewing machine unaided (although for their parents’ benefit – heavily supervised!)</p>
<p>This is a great little project for beginners of any age, but for the reference of anyone planning to do this with children, these two are 7 and 8 and handled it very well. It would certainly be doable if you don’t have a machine too.</p>

						<p>You might notice there’s a different pair of disembodied hands in the post this week. That’s because my lovely housemate was on half term, and ever since we watched this year’s GBBO we have wanted to make our own doughnuts (I’ve been informed donut is the wrong way to spell it). Thanks for your help Vicky and for very patiently allowing me to photograph the occasion.</p>
<p>We’re having a little get together for bonfire/fireworks night on Wednesday and we thought we would make some appropriately themed treats. We bring to you a doughnut double whammy, flavoured with toffee apple and cinder toffee.</p>
<p>Disclaimer – these aren’t quick to make, but they are IN-credible, I was very sad to put them into the freezer, and I hope they emerge as delicious as they went in.</p>

						<p>This week we found ourselves in a bit of a fix. The plan was fondue, but somebody (Peter) forgot to book it. I was a bit sad when I discovered this (months of over eating to stretch my stomach for the big occasion) still, I couldn’t stay grumpy for long, as the gentleman concerned got himself to John Lewis and bought a fondue set. Sometimes it really pays off to have housemates with ridiculous boyfriends.</p>
<p>When I got word that fondue was back on, I figured I would contribute a little something to the dipping pot. So here’s a double whammy post. My seeded granary wonder bread, Pete’s (mainly Nigella’s) cheese fondue.</p>

						<p>Just when you (and I) thought I was going to stop going on about my wedding filled life, one of my best friends decided to get married in December. Of course being a little bit obsessed with her and with craft, I set about thinking up some decoration ideas.</p>
<p>The bride in question hasn’t got a huge budget, so whether you’re due down the aisle yourself, know someone who is, or just fancy brightening up a corner of your living room you won’t be too out of pocket with this one.</p>

Too much GBBO consumed by me I think. The result of these two happenings brings you mini pumpkin pies.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a tin like mine (<del>get one</del>) then this recipe will work as a big pie in a cake tin or whatever you have to hand.</p>
<p>These are super easy to make and totally DE-licious. I recommend them warm with a big dollop of sour cream.</p>

						<p>Chaps! Welcome back, apologies for my prolonged absence. Holidays have been had, possessions been moved, and I’m back online. Still riding high on my summer vacay, everything I thought of for this post was just not seasonal. Autumn is my favourite season usually, but, quite out of character, I’ve actually enjoyed summer this year. To get myself into a cosy autumnal mood I decided to turn an old summer favourite – Eton Mess – into a pudding perfect for fall. I present Autumn Mess (or Fall Mess, I guess, if you’re across the pond, but that sounds a bit too much like a road traffic accident).</p>

Anyway, after opening the rice crispy bites, and popping one in my mouth (it’s good manners to make sure everything is in order for the guests) I moved on to unpacking the rocky road. BINGO. Rocky road Easter nests were born!</p>

<p>A little disclaimer before I begin: the combination of the fact that a) I was making these for a charity bake sale and b) I couldn’t find a regular 4 pack of Mars bars means that the recipe below is rather substantial.

We Brits stay true to form, far more cynical, but with the inherent sense of obligation that both forces us to celebrate something, and then resent the enjoyment we get from it.</p>
