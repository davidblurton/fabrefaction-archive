		<description><![CDATA[Hi Asma,

Thanks! It&#039;s just Sainsbury&#039;s own brand, regular food colouring rather than a paste or gel. Good look with your next go!x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Katie,

These look amazing! As does the rest of the blog.

Just wanted to know which brand of food colouring you used? Every time I&#039;ve made red velvet its a perfect red before it goes in the oven but seems to have a tinge of orange/brown once its out. Not so spectacular as cute little red ones!

Thanks,

As]]></description>
